From time to time I think about what my dream job would be. I like to imagine this because it gives me perspective on my current situation and motivation to strive for better environment in the future.

I like to imagine this perfect, never to be achieved environment just for the purpose of setting direction to my efforts.
So what's it consists of?

Doing Important things
----
Everyone like to be engaged in something big, some of us believe they're changing or disrupting The World. I don't have such an ambitions, I will be satisfied if what I'm producing will be useful, pretty or entertaining to someone. Funny thing is that this "someone" can be me which gives me a perfect position of doing important thing already! I only have to believe it!

Interesting things
---
It has to be interesting, it has to be non-trivial. That's why we're in IT business, right? To solve problems, take challenges and prove ourselves to be smart. Those things we do will be interesting to us if they touch something inside us. I'm deeply interested in seeing how things work, I like to take control over them and make them do something useful. 

People
---
People are very important ingredient of my satisfaction from the job. I love working in an environment that support each other but also motivate to become better in what we're doing but also as humans. Stimulating.
