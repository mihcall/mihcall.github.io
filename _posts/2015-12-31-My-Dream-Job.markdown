date: 	2015-12-30
summary: "From time to time I think about what my dream job would be. I like to imagine this because it gives me perspective on my current situation and motivation to strive for better environment in the future."
---
I like to think about characteristics of a dream job and what it means to me. What would it be like, how would I feel doing it. This helps me understand what should I pursue or how should I influence my current environment to be closer to this ideal.

I was born a fortunate human being. I can think of how my dream job would look like already *having* a job which pays my bills! Whatever led me to the point I'm at (and I'm certain there are many things which contributed to it) I'm grateful for it!

What does this dream job consist of?

  1. Purpose
  2. Independence
  3. Self development
  4. Inspiring people & supportive team
  5. Feedback
  6. Recognition
  7. Money
  8. Environment
  9. Challenges
  10. Fun, happiness & passion

Let me elaborate a little bit on these points.

Purpose
----
It's important to me to do things that have a cause. That's why I engaged myself in a work for communities of different sorts. Some of this work wasn't related to IT.

I wasn't ever dreaming of disrupting the world but I like the feeling that come along with helping someone or making someone's life easier.

Helping someone in her self-development is another source of enormous satisfaction to me.

Independence
---
I feel I don't need a boss anymore. I am ready to plan my self-development. I am ready to choose directions for a company I'm a part of. And by the definition of the work I'm doing I would rather people get out of my way than distract me with their managers' duties.

I had good managers which helped me to develop myself but I think I reached the point I would rather direct myself alone.

I know there are always clients who are demanding and there are peers from which I can learn, I'm talking direct bosses here.

To be honest I'm no longer motivated by authorative "good job/bad job" remarks.

Self development

People & Team
---
People are very important ingredient of my satisfaction from the job. I love working in an environment that supports each other but also motivate to become better in what we're doing but also as humans. Stimulating.

Feedback

Recognition

Yes

Money

I realised many of the thoughts I put into this post are perfectly embodied in a short video about motivation I got to watch time ago. It also brilliantly summarises how I perceive money as a motivator: **"The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table."** from ["Drive: The surprising truth about what motivates us"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc). Please go and watch this video simply because it's brilliant.

Environment

Challenges

Solving problems is extremely satisfying because it leads to better understanding of the world. It also proves your smarts so lot of people seek challenges in their job. I also like how it stimulates many parts of your brain.

Fun, happiness and passion
---
have fun and you'll never have to work again

Summary
---
So is my current environment a perfect one? I hope it'll never be perfect so I have motivation to improve it but giving me a lot of reasons to be happy. The current one is exactly such.

I wish you find your dream job. It's a journey on which you have to define what it means to you. You can change your current job or you can change *things at* your current job. This alone can be satisfying, even if your job will never be perfect. Enjoy this journey!
