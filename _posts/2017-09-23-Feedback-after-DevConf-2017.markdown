Feedback is important for us to become better. It is even more important to us as conference organizers.

So, please tell us what you thought about the conference and we can be sure we improve it next year.

With this in mind, I‚Äôd like to ask you 2 things:

1) please complete our [feedback form](https://devconf.typeform.com/to/qYMj6w) - be honest even if it‚Äôs bad news!
If you have time, please also fill the additional form with feedback for the speakers - they‚Äôre craving your guidance! ([the link](https://devconf.typeform.com/to/SrOlS8) is also available from the main feedback form)

2) please write a brief blog post about the event, it‚Äôs the perfect way to capture the moment, share your thoughts with others, recommend any worth-a-watch sessions (they will all be available on YouTube) and also to let us know where we should focus our efforts for future editions. And just think, it might be the easiest blog post for your ‚ÄúI would like to start/come back to regular blogging‚Äù resolution üòÉ

You can write to us directly at [contact@devconf.pl](mailto:contact@devconf.pl) as well.

Let‚Äôs go one step further...

We‚Äôre more than happy to schedule a phone/skype call with anyone who‚Äôd like to talk about DevConf 2017 and exchange opinions.
Ping us on Twitter, Fb or mail and we‚Äôll schedule a 15-minute retrospective talk with you. You can also use [appoint.ly for that](https://appoint.ly/s/devconf/feedback).

Please do share your thoughts with us, we sincerely want to make DevConf the ultimate software development conference experience for you all.
