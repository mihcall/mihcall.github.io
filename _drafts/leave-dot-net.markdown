It started with this tweet:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This year I will make an attempt to leave .NET and Windows</p>&mdash; Michał Śliwoń (@mihcall) <a href="https://twitter.com/mihcall/status/975683369391534081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2018</a></blockquote>

I would like to pursue this goal because I think it's worth it for a several reasons:

  * I'd like to facilitate my learning
  * I'd like to work on challenging problems
  * I'd like to spend my time in the most productive environment
  * zsh, vim
  * AI, ML
  * I need to change, something fresh
  * community, language
  * does windows + .net have a future?

  Python, Elm
  Kotlin
  Haskell
  Rust
  Node.js
  Elixir
